## The Library Project for TOP

The goal is to showcase what we learned about Objects and Object Constructors by making a Library App. 

Functionality:
1. Add Books to Library.
2. Display every Book in the Library.
3. Remove Books from the Library.
4. Check Reading Status if Book is Read/Unread. 

What I learned while doing the project:
1. The use of `table` element in HTML.
2. How to make a Pop-up form using JS and CSS.
3. Objects: Inheritance and Prototyping.
4. Got a fresh review about Event Listeners.
